## Usage
```rust
use name_maker::RandomNameGenerator;
use name_maker::Gender;

let rng = RandomNameGenerator::init();

// Prints a random name composed of first name and last name.
println!("{}", rng.generate()); 

// Prints a random name with a masculine first name.
println!("{}", rng.generate_specific(Gender::Male));

// Returns a vector with 5 random names.
let random_names = rng.generate_many(5);

// Returns a vector with 5 random names with feminine first names.
let random_girls = rng.generate_many_specific(0, 5);

// Returns a vector with 5 random names with similar last name.
// The first and second element are the "parents" and the succeeding
// elements are their "children".
let family = rng.generate_family(3);

// It is also possible to specify the number of male and female children
// in the family. In this example, the family have 5 boys and 1 girl.
